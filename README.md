# Bookbot

**Bookbot** is my first project in the "Back-end Developer Career Path" roadmap by [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/tracks/backend). It's a command-line application written in Python that performs static analysis on text files. Think of it as a tool for exploring the structure and content of novels, such as *Frankenstein*.

## Features
- Analyze entire text files or novels.
- Gain insights into word counts, sentence structure, and more.

## Why Bookbot?
I built Bookbot as a fun project to practice Python and experiment with building command-line applications.

## Next Steps
- Adding support for more text formats (e.g., `.epub`, `.docx`).
- Incorporating natural language processing (NLP) for deeper text insights.
- Creating a web interface for Bookbot in the future!
